# Project Overview

**Dataset Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Layoffs**

This project involves cleaning a dataset sourced from GitHub containing 2800+ entries detailing layoffs across various companies during a specific period. The data cleaning process ensures the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

## Cleaning the Dataset

**1. Problem:**
The dataset sourced from GitHub, with 2800+ layoff entries across companies, likely suffers from inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This could include typos in company names, inconsistent date formats, missing information in key fields, or duplicate entries, all of which can skew analysis and lead to misleading conclusions.

**2. Solution:**
Implement a rigorous data cleaning process to address inconsistencies and inaccuracies:
- **Remove Duplicates:** Ensure each layoff event is represented only once.
- **Standardize Formats:** Convert dates to a consistent format and ensure uniform capitalization for company names.
- **Data Validation:** Check for inconsistencies such as unrealistic layoff numbers or nonsensical department names.

**3. Outcome:**
The data cleaning process results in a dataset that is accurate, consistent, and prepared for in-depth analysis. This cleaned dataset enables researchers to draw reliable conclusions about layoffs across companies during the specified period, identifying trends, patterns, and potential causes.

## Performing EDA on Clean Dataset

After cleaning the data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is essential for understanding the dataset's structure and uncovering insights.

- **Identify Patterns and Trends:** Use visualizations to explore relationships between variables like company size, industry, layoff reasons, and dates.
- **Detect Outliers:** EDA reveals unusual data points that may indicate errors or require further investigation, ensuring data integrity.

These insights from EDA guide subsequent analysis and aid in selecting appropriate statistical methods to address research questions about layoff data.
