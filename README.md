This project involves cleaning a dataset sourced from GitHub and performing EDA on it. Consisting of 2800+ entries detailing layoffs across various companies during a specific period. The data cleaning process ensures the dataset is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis.

1. Cleaning a dataset:
   
1. Problem: Dataset sourced from GitHub with 2800+ layoff entries across companies likely suffers from inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This could include typos in company names, inconsistent date formats, missing information in key fields, or even duplicate entries. These issues can significantly skew analysis and lead to misleading conclusions.

2. Solution: Implement a data cleaning process to address these inconsistencies and inaccuracies. This might involve techniques like:
Identifying and removing duplicates: Ensure each layoff event is represented only once.
Standardizing formats: Convert dates to a consistent format and ensure company names use a uniform capitalization style.
Data validation: Check for inconsistencies and errors like unrealistic numbers of layoffs or nonsensical department names.

3. Outcome: The data cleaning process will result in a dataset that is accurate, consistent, and ready for further analysis. This cleaned dataset will allow researchers to draw reliable conclusions about layoffs across companies during the specified period. They can identify trends, patterns, and potential causes for these layoffs.

#Process of Data cleaning
#---1. Remove Duplicates
#---2. Standardize the data (Like spelling mistakes)
#---3. Null values or blank values
#---4. Remove unnecessary columns and rows

2. Perform EDA on clean dataset:
   
After cleaning the data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial to understanding the data's underlying structure and uncovering potential insights.

Identify patterns and trends: We can use visualizations to explore relationships between variables like company size, industry, layoff reasons, and date of layoff. 

Detect outliers: EDA can reveal unusual data points that might require further investigation or potentially indicate data collection errors.

These insights from EDA are essential for guiding further analysis and choosing the most appropriate statistical methods to answer our research questions about the layoff data.
